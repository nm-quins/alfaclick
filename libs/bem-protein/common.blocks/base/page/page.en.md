_Inherited from bem-core/common.blocks/page_

Default html structure: html>head+body. Also contain elements for requiring scripts and styles.
By default we don't use i-bem and don't include it to final .js. See how in page.deps.js.

For more info and examples see bower_components/bem-core/common.blocks/page/page.examples
